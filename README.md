OpenCv Operations using Python

1)Read and Display an Image using OpenCV/PIL. Decrease each pixel value by a factor of 2 and
save the resultant image.

2)Convert the image to grayscale and save it after resizing to XxY dimensions. 

3)Traverse through all the pixels of the image and remove all of the red intensities. Output the
 changed image and note your observations. For the original image, change the blue intensities
 with red, red with green, and green with blue. Again output the image and note your
 observations.

4)Convert the RGB image used in Question 1 into HSI, YCbCr and save it. Also crop the
  RGB image into 4 parts. Get patches and then again concatenate them into a single image.
